# Kaggle_Competition_Zillow
The current code Quan and I have for the Zillow competition on kaggle.
The code currently in the zillow_demo.py file is written in python and uses various modules like pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, etc.
The code in zillow_demo.py initially reads downloaded csv files (prop, train_2016, sample_submission) to the code from the Zillow competitions data folder linked below, all other read_from_csv methods read some sort of modified file we saved after cleaning had been done to the data.
